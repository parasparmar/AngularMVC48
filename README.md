# AngularMVC48
This is my attempt at recreating an Angular 11 app on ASP.NET 4.8 MVC with Web API. It was referenced from Mithun MVP's instructions at https://mithunvp.com/angular-asp-net-mvc-5-angular-cli-visual-studio-2017/ 
It works almost as well as if this came from a VS template.
These days .NET Core gets all the love from devs (deservedly so). However, in my case, some of my clients requested this combination of technologies for their specific requirements. I hope it helps you too. 

The person who gave me this gave it freely and so do I pass it on to you.
